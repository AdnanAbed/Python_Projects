    "Hypothesis:\n",
    "\n",
    "The observation that the growth in total seats is higher than the growth in total earnings (`total_usd`) can be attributed to several potential reasons. Here are some possible explanations:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "1. **Price Reductions or Discounts:**\r\n",
    "   - If there were price reductions, promotions, or discounts offered during 2023, this could lead to an increase in the number of seats sold while the total earnings did not increase proportionally.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "2. **Change in Product/Service Mix:**\r\n",
    "   - There might have been a shift in the mix of products or services being sold. For example, more lower-priced options could have been sold in 2023 compared to higher-priced options in 2019.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "3. **Market Saturation:**\r\n",
    "   - The market might be reaching a saturation point where additional seats sold do not correspond to proportional increases in revenue due to market competition or reduced willingness to pay.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "4. **Economic Factors:**\r\n",
    "   - Economic downturns or other macroeconomic factors could result in customers being more price-sensitive, leading to higher sales volumes at lower price points.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "5. **Operational Changes:**\r\n",
    "   - Operational changes, such as increasing capacity or adding more seats to meet demand without a corresponding increase in pricing, could lead to more seats being sold at the same or lower prices.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "6. **Increased Competition:**\r\n",
    "   - Increased competition may force the company to lower prices to remain competitive, resulting in higher seat sales but lower revenue per seat.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "7. **Promotional Strategies:**\r\n",
    "   - Aggressive marketing campaigns focusing on increasing volume rather than revenue could have driven up the number of seats sold without significantly increasing earnings.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "8. **Customer Behavior Changes:**\r\n",
    "   - Changes in customer behavior, such as a preference for cheaper options or shorter durations, could lead to an increase in the number of seats sold but not a proportional increase in total revenue.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "To gain a clearer understanding of the specific reasons for your case, consider the following additional analyses:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **Price Analysis:**\r\n",
    "  - Analyze the average price per seat over the years to see if there has been a significant drop in prices.\r\n",
    "  \r\n",
    "- **Revenue Segmentation:**\r\n",
    "  - Break down the total earnings by product or service categories to identify if certain segments have experienced a decline in average revenue per seat.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **Promotional Impact:**\r\n",
    "  - Examine the impact of promotions, discounts, and other pricing strategies over time.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **Customer Demographics and Preferences:**\r\n",
    "  - Study changes in customer demographics and preferences to understand if there is a shift towards cheaper or different types of services.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "By conducting these additional analyses, you can pinpoint more accurately which factors are contributing to the observed trends in earnings and seat demand."

    "Based on the provided data schema and the identified drop in Eran per Seat (eps) from 2019 to 2023, here are three hypotheses and recommendations for increasing sales and revenue, ranked by business value:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### 1. **Optimize Pricing Strategy (High Business Value)**\r\n",
    "   **Hypothesis:** Adjusting the pricing strategy to reflect market demand and competitive positioning can enhance revenue per seat.\r\n",
    "   \r\n",
    "   **Recommendations:**\r\n",
    "   - **Dynamic Pricing:** Implement dynamic pricing models that adjust ticket prices based on factors such as demand, time to departure, and competition. For instance, increase prices during peak travel times and offer discounts during off-peak times.\r\n",
    "   - **Segmentation:** Offer different pricing tiers based on customer segments, such as economy, business, and premium seats, to cater to varying customer preferences and willingness to pay.\r\n",
    "   - **Promotions and Discounts:** Run targeted promotions and discounts for specific routes or times that typically experience lower occupancy to increase seat utiland overall business performance."
